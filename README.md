# tron-wallet-cli (Bun edition)

Multi-profile Tron wallet CLI using Bun and `bun:sqlite`. Generate keypairs,
store multiple named profiles locally, and send TRX / TRC-20 USDT.

## Setup

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env
# optionally set WALLET_MASTER_KEY in .env to encrypt private keys at rest
# optionally set TRONGRID_API_KEY (free at https://www.trongrid.io/)
```

Profiles are stored in a local SQLite DB at `~/.tron-wallet-cli/wallet.db`
by default. Override the location with `WALLET_DATA_DIR` — see
[Storing the DB on Proton Drive](#storing-the-db-on-proton-drive-macos) below.

## Profile management

```bash
# Create a new profile (generates a fresh keypair)
bun index.ts profile add alice

# Import an existing private key as a profile
bun index.ts profile import bob <privateKeyHex>

# List all profiles (marks the active one with *)
bun index.ts profile list

# Set which profile is "active" (used by default for balance/send)
bun index.ts profile use alice

# Show a profile's address; add --reveal to also print the private key
bun index.ts profile show alice
bun index.ts profile show alice --reveal

# Delete a profile
bun index.ts profile remove bob
```

## Wallet commands

```bash
# Check balance for a specific profile, or the active one if omitted
bun index.ts balance
bun index.ts balance alice

# Show transaction history (aliases: txs, history)
bun index.ts transactions
bun index.ts transactions alice

# Last 100 instead of the default 20, or the complete history
bun index.ts transactions --limit 100
bun index.ts transactions --all

# Filter by type, or get machine-readable output
bun index.ts transactions --type usdt
bun index.ts transactions --type trx
bun index.ts transactions --json

# Send TRX / USDT using the active profile
bun index.ts send-trx <toAddress> <amount>
bun index.ts send-usdt <toAddress> <amount>

# Or specify a profile explicitly
bun index.ts send-trx <toAddress> <amount> --profile alice
bun index.ts send-usdt <toAddress> <amount> --profile alice

# Check the current rate without swapping anything
bun index.ts swap trx-usdt 100 --quote

# Swap 100 TRX for USDT, or 50 USDT back to TRX
bun index.ts swap trx-usdt 100
bun index.ts swap usdt-trx 50
```

### Transaction history

`transactions` reads history from TronGrid's v1 REST API — TronWeb itself
only exposes single-transaction lookups, with no "list this account's
transactions" call. Two endpoints are merged: native transactions (TRX
transfers, contract calls, staking) and TRC-20 transfer events. A USDT send
appears in both, so the native row is dropped when the TRC-20 stream already
described that txID with real token amounts.

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--limit <n>` | Number of transactions to show (default 20) |
| `--all` | Fetch the complete history with no limit |
| `--type <trx\|usdt\|trc20\|all>` | Filter by transfer type (default `all`) |
| `--json` | Print raw JSON instead of the table |
| `--profile <name>` | Profile to use, instead of the active one |

Filters are applied while paging, so `--type trx` keeps looking until it has
`--limit` actual TRX transfers rather than filtering one page and giving up.
Filtered scans stop after 5,000 transactions unless you pass `--all`.

If `TRON_FULL_HOST` points at a self-hosted full node, set `TRONGRID_API_HOST`
as well — a bare node serves no `/v1` routes, so history lookups need a
TronGrid host.

### Swapping TRX <-> USDT

`swap` trades against [SunSwap V2](https://sunswap.com/), Tron's Uniswap-V2
fork, by calling its router contract directly — no exchange account, no API
key, and the funds never leave the profile's address.

```bash
# Always free to ask: a constant call, nothing is signed or sent
bun index.ts swap trx-usdt 100 --quote

bun index.ts swap trx-usdt 100 --slippage 1
bun index.ts swap usdt-trx 50 --profile alice
```

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--quote` | Print the current rate and exit without swapping |
| `--slippage <percent>` | Maximum acceptable slippage (default `0.5`) |
| `--reserve <trx>` | TRX held back to pay fees (default `30`) |
| `--deadline <minutes>` | How long the swap stays valid on-chain (default `10`) |
| `--profile <name>` | Profile to use, instead of the active one |

Each swap quotes the router with `getAmountsOut`, converts that quote into an
`amountOutMin` using `--slippage`, and only then signs. The minimum is what
stops a sandwich bot from taking the trade at an arbitrary price — a swap that
would land below it reverts instead of executing.

Direction matters for what actually happens on-chain:

- **`trx-usdt`** sends native TRX as the call's value, so it's a single
  transaction with no allowance step.
- **`usdt-trx`** is a TRC-20 spend, so the router needs an allowance first.
  The CLI checks the current allowance and only sends an `approve` when it
  falls short — and clears a stale non-zero allowance first, since Tether-style
  tokens reject a non-zero to non-zero approval outright. That makes it up to
  three transactions.

After sending, the CLI waits for the receipt rather than trusting the txID:
`send()` resolves as soon as a node accepts the transaction, which says nothing
about whether it executed. The final "received" figure is read out of the
receipt logs (the token's `Transfer` event, or WTRX's `Withdrawal` for TRX out),
so it's the amount that actually arrived, not the pre-trade quote.

The `--reserve` default keeps 30 TRX back on `trx-usdt` swaps. Swapping a whole
balance leaves nothing to pay the next transaction's bandwidth and energy with,
which is an easy way to strand an account. Set `--reserve 0` if you know what
you're doing.

## Storing the DB on Proton Drive (macOS)

Proton Drive's desktop app syncs a local folder to the cloud, so pointing
`WALLET_DATA_DIR` at a folder inside it works like any other local path —
Proton Drive handles the sync in the background.

1. Find your local Proton Drive sync folder. It's typically:
   ```
   ~/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-<your-email>/My files
   ```
   (Check Proton Drive's app settings if the exact path differs for you.)

2. Point the CLI at a subfolder there, e.g. in your `.env`:
   ```
   WALLET_DATA_DIR=/Users/yourname/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-you@proton.me/My files/tron-wallet-cli
   ```
   or export it in your shell profile:
   ```bash
   export WALLET_DATA_DIR="$HOME/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-you@proton.me/My files/tron-wallet-cli"
   ```

3. Run any command as usual — the `wallet.db` file will be created there and
   Proton Drive will sync it like any other file.

**Important caveats for a synced DB:**

- **Set `WALLET_MASTER_KEY`.** Anything in a cloud-synced folder should be
  treated as "at rest in the cloud" — encrypt the private keys before they
  ever touch Proton's servers, even though Proton Drive itself is
  end-to-end encrypted.
- **Don't run the CLI from two devices at the same time.** SQLite handles
  concurrent access on one machine fine, but two machines writing to the
  same synced file near-simultaneously can create sync conflicts (Proton
  Drive will usually save a conflicted copy rather than corrupt data, but
  you don't want to find that out mid-transaction).
- **Wait for sync to finish** after a write (`profile add`, `send-trx`,
  etc.) before switching to another device, so you're not reading a
  stale/partially-synced copy.
- This CLI pins the DB to SQLite's `DELETE` journal mode specifically
  because it's safer for synced folders than `WAL` mode (which spreads
  writes across extra sidecar files that can desync from the main `.db`
  file).
- Treat it like a shared, syncable secrets file: a proper backup/version
  history (which Proton Drive does provide) is a nice side benefit here,
  but it's not a substitute for exporting/backing up private keys
  separately if you're managing meaningful funds.

## Encryption at rest

If `WALLET_MASTER_KEY` is set in your environment, private keys are encrypted
with AES-256-GCM (key derived via scrypt) before being written to SQLite.
If it's unset, keys are stored in plaintext — fine for local testing, not
recommended for anything holding real funds.

```bash
export WALLET_MASTER_KEY="a long random passphrase"
bun index.ts profile add prod-wallet
```

**Important:** if you lose `WALLET_MASTER_KEY`, encrypted private keys in the
DB become unrecoverable. Back up your master key and/or exported private
keys separately.

## Making it globally runnable (optional)

```bash
chmod +x index.ts
bun link
tron-wallet profile list
```

## Notes

- New addresses need a small amount of TRX before sending anything, since
  Tron transactions consume TRX for bandwidth/energy.
- `feeLimit` in send-usdt is a cap, not a fixed cost — typical TRC-20
  transfers burn a few TRX worth of energy unless the account has
  pre-staked energy. Swaps use a higher cap (100 TRX) because they touch
  the router, the pool and the TRX wrapper in one transaction.
- Never commit `.env`, the SQLite DB file, or logs containing revealed keys.
